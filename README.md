## Lab assignment
[Lab 1: 32-bit ALU](/Lab1)
<br/>
Implement a `32-bit ALU` (Arithmetic Logic Unit). ALU is the basic computing component of a CPU. Its operations include AND, OR, addition, subtraction, etc. 
<br/>

[Lab 2: Single Cycle CPU](/Lab2)
<br>
Utilizing the ALU in Lab1 to implement a ` single cycle CPU`.
<br/>

[Lab 3: Pipelined CPU](/Lab3)
<br>
Based on your Lab2 CPU design, implement a `pipelined CPU`. 
<br/>

[Lab 4: Advanced Pipelined CPU](/Lab4)
<br>
Modify Lab3 CPU design, and implement an advanced pipelined CPU with `hazard detection` and `data forwarding`
<br/>
